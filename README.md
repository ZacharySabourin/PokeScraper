# PokeScraper
Scrape Pokemon.com for Pokemon information and upload to a MySQL database.
I will be using the database for a Pokedex application I will be creating.
May need to scrape more info in the future but most of  the basic info is covered.


What I Learned:
  - Practiced the "Single Responsibility Principal"
    - Worked on separating functionality to maintain readability and facilitate maintenance
  - Learned how to scrape a website
  - Set up a simple server using MAMP
  - Practiced my ability to use a MySQL database
